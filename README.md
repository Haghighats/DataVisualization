Data Visualization:

I've been working on a project to analyze weather data for England, with humidity as the target. I was curious to understand how factors like temperature and wind speed might influence humidity levels. You can find the summary of my work on this data below:
•	Data Cleaning:
o	Addressed missing values in one column (categorical) by replacing them with the most frequent value (mode).
o	Identified and removed 24 duplicate entries.
•	Data Preparation for Visualization:
o	Transformed data into separate dataframes for hourly, weekly, and monthly analysis using time series analysis.
I used various libraries to create informative visualizations:
•	Seaborn: Primary library for creating user-friendly and interactive plots to uncover insights.
•	Sweetviz: Used for a quick exploratory data analysis.
The visualizations involved three stages:
•	Univariate Analysis: Examining individual variables.
•	Bivariate Analysis: Exploring relationships between two variables (e.g., temperature and humidity).
•	Multivariate Analysis: Investigating relationships between multiple variables.
Time-converted data was used throughout to ensure clear and informative visualizations.
Feel free to explore the code and let me know if you have any questions.
