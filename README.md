#  Data Visualization of England Weather:  

I've been working on a project to analyze weather data for England, with humidity as the target. I was curious to understand how factors like temperature and wind speed might influence humidity levels. You can find the summary of my work on this data below: <br><br>
**•	Data Cleaning:** <br>
  o	Addressed missing values in one column (categorical) by replacing them with the most frequent value (mode). <br>
  o	Identified and removed 24 duplicate entries.<br><br>
**•	Data Preparation for Visualization:** <br>
  o	Time-converted data was used throughout to ensure clear and informative visualizations.<br> I Transformed data into separate dataframes for hourly, weekly, and monthly analysis using time series analysis.<br><br>
I used various libraries to create informative visualizations:<br>
  **•	Seaborn:** Primary library for creating user-friendly and interactive plots to uncover insights.<br>
  **•	Sweetviz:** Used for a quick exploratory data analysis.<br><br>
The visualizations involved three stages:<br>
  **•	Univariate Analysis:** Examining individual variables.<br>
  **•	Bivariate Analysis:** Exploring relationships between two variables (e.g., temperature and humidity).<br>
  **•	Multivariate Analysis:** Investigating relationships between multiple variables.<br>
<br>
